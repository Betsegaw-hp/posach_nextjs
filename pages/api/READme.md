# Note
_____________________________________________________________
I refactore my code to *not use* ***api route*** beacuse:  
> You should not use fetch() to call an API route in getServerSideProps.
> Instead, directly import the logic used inside your API route.
> You may need to slightly refactor your code for this approach.
> Fetching from an external API is fine!
